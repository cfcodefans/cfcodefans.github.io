[react-static](https://react-static.js.org/) is a static web page generator.
We can define some functions in static.config.js to load data, and render 
these data with templates built by react components. These templates are also
organized by [React-Static Route](https://github.com/react-static/react-static/blob/master/docs/api.md#routes)
