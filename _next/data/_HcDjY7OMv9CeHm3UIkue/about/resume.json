SNMP and CLI are two mainly measures used in device operations.\nThis product has been developed for couple yearsnetnumen Network Management, and it is \ngetting more capable of  management of big scale network. our target is to make it more \neffective and robust.\n\nResponsibilities:\n   I am working in support group that developers utilities modules relieving other\nworkmates of trifles such as DB operations, UI pattern. we found that most of \nbusiness modules might include same functions, and we abstract those, and plan to\nbuild support base module, this was my challenging job.\n\n    Lesson I learned, To develop base components used to support many other \nconcrete modules, it is important not to abuse design patterns and complicate the \ninterface. otherwise, colleagues would hate your over-engineering code. More over, \ninterfaces should be made flexible enough with OOP principles so that components \ncan be reused in various cases at minimum cost, otherwise your manager would hate \nyour code.\n</code></pre><h5>Projects</h5><h6>5.3.1 netnumen Network Management (May 2008 – Aug 2010)</h6><pre><code>This platform is developed by ZTE data network department.
