As I studied so far, [Open-Graph-Protocol](https://ogp.me/){target="_blank"} is the protocol recognized by social network. In detail,
you could add certain set of meta tags into your web pages, then when the web pages are shared by links in soical networks, such as 
[linkedin](https://linkedin.com/), the social network could extract the info from the meta tags according to Open Graph Protocol 
and display these info to make the shared links more informative.
