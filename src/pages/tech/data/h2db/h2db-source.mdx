I want to study more about database, not just how to query and store data.
I wish to know how a database is built, what concerns are to be addressed.
I figure [h2databasae](https://h2database.com) could be a good starting point

H2 database is full-featured database implemented using Java.
So it would appear a bit more easier for javaer like me to study how exactly
a RDB system is architected and built.
