Objectives</h2>\r\n    \r\n    Hi, I am Chen Fan. \r\n\r\n       I have been working as a java coder and enthusiastic about coding (so much to learn).  \r\n    I aspire to further my programming knowledge, skills and vision of the evolving internet. \r\n\r\n        I firmly believe that internet driven services will flourish through innovations and \r\n    connection to other industries thus I wish to participate this exploratory process. I \r\n    believe \r\n        I could contribute to business success with combination of my experience, creativity, \r\n    team spirit, most importantly learning ability.\r\n\r\n    Thanks and best regards. \r\n","path":"blogs/about/resume.mdx"}],"path":"blogs/about"}
