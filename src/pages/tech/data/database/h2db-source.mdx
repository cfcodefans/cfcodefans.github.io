I want to study more about database, not just how to query and store data.
I wish to know how a database is built, what concerns are to be addressed.
I figure [h2database](https://h2database.com) could be a good starting point
<!--more-->

H2 database is full-featured database implemented using Java.
So it would appear a bit more easier for javaer like me to study how exactly
a RDB system is architected and built.

**Update at 2022-11-23**
There are about 1000 java files in h2database project, going through them in 
a more structured way has been harder than expected. 

There is a language study method called [shadow](https://oxfordhousebcn.com/en/shadowing-improve-fluency-at-c2-level/), 
which is about repeating speech of language you learn. so I thought, I like using kotlin so much,
maybe I can apply the "shadowing" in study of h2database source code, translate the source code 
from Java to Kotlin. The process of translation could help me understand the structure, features
of h2database better.

So, I have been doing it at [here](https://github.com/cfcodefans/data-kit/tree/master/h2db-study)...It is far from finish,
not even half way. Anyway, rome is not built in one night :).
