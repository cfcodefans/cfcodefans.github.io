A note from my study about how to setup and use nginx. 

<!--more-->

# Installation

Here I use centos system, so according to [nginx offical document](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/tutorials/install/)
Firstly it needs to add nginx yum repo by creation of file at **/etc/yum.repos.d/nginx.repo**

```bash
# cat /etc/yum.repos.d/nginx.repo
[nginx]
name=nginx repo
baseurl=https://nginx.org/packages/centos/8/x86_64/
gpgcheck=0
enabled=1
```

I was not sure about the version of the server, then found a command that could show some system info

```bash
# hostnamectl
.....
  Operating System: CentOS Linux 8
       CPE OS Name: cpe:/o:centos:centos:8
            Kernel: Linux 4.18.0-240.1.1.el8_3.x86_64
      Architecture: x86-64
```
Therefore, the repo path should be "nginx.org/packages/centos/**8/x86_64**/"

continue with "yum install nginx"

After installation finished, we could check if [systemd](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/systemd#Basic_systemctl_usage) is setup

```bash
# systemctl status nginx
‚óè nginx.service - The nginx HTTP and reverse proxy server
   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/nginx.service; disabled; vendor preset: disabled)
   Active: inactive (dead)

.... nginx.service: Unit cannot be reloaded because it is inactive.
```

# Configuration

Nginx Configuration, it should be called "nginx programming", since nginx can do a lot, especially with [lua](http://www.lua.org/docs.html)
I started with a simple one

### gzip
```
gzip off;
gzip_http_version 1.1;
gzip_comp_level 2;
gzip_types text/plain application/javascript application/x-javascript text/css application/xml text/javascript application/x-httpd-php image/jpeg image/gif image/png;
```
