Jun 2012 – Present . 6 yrs 11 mos at Shanghai China</p><pre><code>As Java coder, I started with development of services built with java
</code></pre><p>, supporting our websites. Image/Video process, Message queuing, Payment,
Single Sign On, Blockchain(NEM)....</p><pre><code>Gradually, I have studied and shifted to data area as our team aims to 
</code></pre><p>become data driven. I familiarize tools/framework for data mining, which brought
me to new horizon.</p><pre><code>As technology &amp; tools always evolve and improve to be more user-friendly, 
</code></pre><p>I still feel quite distant to the math/statistic principles behind data science.</p><pre><code>As we generate more and more data in our lives, data also shapes our minds.
</code></pre><p>I wish to explore more in this complexity.</p><pre><code>In practice, apart from development for java systems, I have also been working 
</code></pre><p>as data engineer, setting up infrastructures like Hadoop cluster, Hive, Kafka.
Process clean data for data scientists.</p><pre><code>Overall, I grow with sharing knowleages between amazing colleagues.
</code></pre><h5>Projects</h5><h6>5.1.1 Community-Token (Feb 2018 - Present) <span><a target="_blank" href="https://nem.io/">NEM</a>  <a target="_blank" href="https://nem.io/">[+]</a></span> / Kotlin / Spring-Boot / Mongodb</h6><p>The idea is to implement some reward mechanism to reward active users who create great
content, contribute in our online community. The trick is possible monetary incentive
associated with crypto currency for users, as well as other benefit of block chain tech,
such as transparency, immutability, convenient as well.</p><p>In detail, NEM features:</p><ol><li>proof of importance,</li><li>multi-sign transaction</li><li>escrow</li><li>atomic swap(exchange) </li></ol><p>However the transaction speed is always critical impediment to block chain application,
caused by nature of block chain tech. To address, we adopt private chain, similar to
Bitcoin&#x27;s lightning network.</p><p> </p><h6>5.1.2 Data-Service-ETL (May 2019 – Present) <span><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/alibaba/canal">Canal</a>  <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/alibaba/canal">[+]</a></span> / Hive / <span><a href="https://gpdb.docs.pivotal.io/6-0/main/index.html">Green Plum</a>  <a href="https://gpdb.docs.pivotal.io/6-0/main/index.html" target="_blank">[+]</a></span> / <span><a href="https://superset.incubator.apache.org/">Superset</a>  <a href="https://superset.incubator.apache.org/" target="_blank">[+]</a></span></h6><p>For data collected from Kafka, I developed UDF in Hive which could pull data from kafka
with in certain time window defined as parameters. This primarily collects data generated
by users&#x27; actions, as fact table.</p><p>Besides this, Canal can impersonate a mysql slave to collect data changes on a mysql instance.
Dimenson tables changes are collected and stored by date.</p><p>Raw data (ods) collected and load into Hive tables where ETL processes are implemented by
Hive SQL, which could utilize some UDF functions I developed, to operate data via http
services, Redis, Zookeeper. Hive Storage Handler is also very useful for Hive to access
data in various JDBC-compatible data source.</p><p>Data in Hive is loaded into GreenPlum, which is multiple Postgresql instances organized
in cluster, able to support adhoc queries. </p><p>Last piece is Superset, a BI tool which renders data with dozens of different charts.</p><p> </p><h6>5.1.3 Data-Service-setup (Jul 2018 – Present) Hadoop / Zookeeper / Kafka / Hive / Green Plum</h6><p>Install, deploy and configure Hadoop cluster, with High Availability feature, optimized
settings.</p><p>Install and integrate components for our data services, including: Kafka for event bus;
Hive for ETL engineer; Green Plum for storage for adhoc queries/charts; Zookeeper to
support others.</p><p> </p><h6>5.1.4 Single-Sign-On (Feb 2018 – Jul 2018) <span><a target="_blank" href="https://oltu.apache.org/">Apache Oltu</a>  <a target="_blank" href="https://oltu.apache.org/">[+]</a></span> / Mongodb / Scala / LDAP</h6><p>A single sign on feature built with Apache Oltu Library and LDAP using scala/jersey/webservice,
it guards our internal services for users from different departments.</p><p> </p><h6>5.1.5 Data-misc-tools (Jul 2017 – Feb 2018) Hive / Kafka / Redis / Mysql</h6><p>This project hosts several tools to help with development using Hive, Spark. Please check it
out on github</p><p>To study and apply how to leverage new features of Hive, Spark, Hadoop for data process, I
created and am developing some functions for Hive and spark. It sounds like reinventing wheel,
but I believe it has certain value as:</p><ol><li>it utilizes the dynamic characteristic of scala language, so that it recognizes the
modification of scala script files on HDFS, takes effect immediately, saving the cumbersome
steps of compile, package, deployment, restart spark process. Theoretically this can apply
other JSR233 compatible languages.</li></ol><p>1.1 I have finished the feature to support python as well, python code can be saved and edited
with HUE, then it will take effect immediately too</p><ol start="2"><li><p>It can use just HIVE sql to load/send data via HTTP, kafka, Redis with extended HIVE
function. Most of a ETL process can be implemented by only HIVE sql.</p></li><li><p>Some supportive features are also provided, such simple task scheduler, task execution
tracking.</p></li></ol><p>Feedback or contribution is highly appreciated.

and extract thumbnails. I developed this based on Red5 Server with Spring, Spring-MVC and
kotlin.</p><p>Besides these, we are developing video live-streaming feature to meet the needs of
watching video stream on browser of mobile as we learn that majority of accesses
are from mobile phones.</p><p> </p><h6>5.1.6 IPS (Image Process Service) (Jan 2013 - Jul 2018) <span><a target="_blank" href="https://opencv.org/">OpenCV</a>  <a target="_blank" href="https://opencv.org/">[+]</a></span> / Kotlin / Spring-boot</h6><p>The service processes images uploaded by users, with features of crop, scale, overlay
text and other images, rotate. </p><p>The design borrowed the idea of CSS, we define some schemas in json like css to describe
how the images should be crop, scale, ...etc. Like CSS, we also had variables in the
schemas so image processing could be dynamic according to requests.</p><p>The development for this is ongoing for years, as we always found some new challenges.
Firstly, with upgrade of mobile phones of users led to images significantly increasing in
both number and size (3000x2000-ish) over just couple of years. The early version of IPS
failed to process images fast. </p><p>After studying logs and tests, I firstly made processing executed in parallel threads to
maximize use of multi-cores; checked the memory footprint to reduce unnecessary copy
(image data is massive after uncompressing); replaced Processing Library (based on Java)
with OpenCV (based on C++);</p><p>I also tried to extend it to support GIF, face recognition, similar image search, etc.</p><p> </p><h6>5.1.7 Joint (Jul 2014 – Jul 2015) <span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-ee-glance.html">JavaEE</a>  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-ee-glance.html">[+]</a></span> / <span><a href="https://swagger.io/">Swagger</a>  <a href="https://swagger.io/" target="_blank">[+]</a></span></h6><p>This is actually a open-source and study project. I noticed the great development of
frontend technology and gap between it with backend technology.</p><p>Before, Backend tech stack (JSF, PHP...) covers the rendering of HTML with template
technology. These became quickly outmoded as webpage development were taken over by
Javascript libraries.</p><p>However, backend turns to service oriented. Restful services were described by WSDL,
which was not recognized by javascript(since js is dynamic, weak-typed language).</p><p>Finally, Typescript alleivated the problem but not ultimate solution. I tried to build
some library to read, parse the annotations on Restful service API, and automatically
generate whole bunch of typescript definitions for service invocation.</p><p>Now we know that Swagger does this way better. I still learned a lot from this useless
project.</p><p> </p><h6>5.1.7 MQueue Dispatcher (Mar 2014 – 2016) <span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.rabbitmq.com">Rabbit MQueue</a>  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.rabbitmq.com">[+]</a></span> / Java 8 / React</h6><p>The system constantly consumes messages from Rabbit MQueue according to predefined rules,
relays messages over http protocol to corresponding PHP modules. It also implements retry
mechanism and failed messages storage for maintenance.</p><p>The design is a series of producer-consumer patterns combined with state transit, with
each step performs different tasks: </p><ol><li>pull from queue; </li><li>post to http service;</li><li>check result to decide whether to:
3.1 reply queue with ack;
3.2 store failed message, mark the retry count;</li></ol><p>The challenge is building a fast assembly line with async queues, and tweak performance
of HTTP library. </p><p> </p><h5>5.1.8 Search Service (Oct 2019 - present)</h5><p>Solr based full text search service, designed and developed to support websites,
End users search profiles, locations, feeds via search service,
on the other handle, Data service collects users&#x27; search keyword and following browse
actions, to feed related data analysis.</p><p> </p><p> </p><h4>5.2 Senior Java Engineer</h4><p>At <span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.dbschenker.com/global">DB Schenker SSC</a>  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dbschenker.com/global">[+]</a></span>

Operation Systems are both of windows and Solarise (lots of NMS run on SUN server)
, so Java and Swing UI could be the best option.</p><pre><code>JEE techniques, such as EJB, JMS, are very helpful for building highly flexible

This product has been developed for couple yearsnetnumen Network Management, and it is
getting more capable of  management of big scale network. our target is to make it more
effective and robust.</p><p>Responsibilities:
I am working in support group that developers utilities modules relieving other
workmates of trifles such as DB operations, UI pattern. we found that most of
business modules might include same functions, and we abstract those, and plan to
build support base module, this was my challenging job.</p><pre><code>Lesson I learned, To develop base components used to support many other 
</code></pre><p>concrete modules, it is important not to abuse design patterns and complicate the
interface. otherwise, colleagues would hate your over-engineering code. More over,
interfaces should be made flexible enough with OOP principles so that components
can be reused in various cases at minimum cost, otherwise your manager would hate
your code.</p><h5>Projects</h5><h6>5.3.1 netnumen Network Management (May 2008 – Aug 2010)</h6><p>This platform is developed by ZTE data network department. It consists of components
of network interface, SNMP, telnet, Persistence layer, User Interfaces assembled in
a modular manner. </p><p>From technical point of view, it is empowered by combination of JEE and Swing
tech stack so it is portable and compatible to different databases and other
systems built on Java.</p><p>From architecture point of view, It is designed to be modular and extensible.
Components for different business logics are developed easily based on platform
infrastructure modules, they interact via interfaces and JMS message.</p><p>As to my work in this project, I was tasked to develop utilities and UI framework
to support other colleagues&#x27; development. I applied design patterns inside the
module for flexibility and modularity and exposed interfaces for simplicity. Users
simply use them or inherit them. </p><p> </p><h4>5.4 Senior Java Engineer</h4><p>At <span><a target="_blank" href="http://www.lianchuang.com/">AsiaInfo Linkage</a>  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lianchuang.com/">[+]</a></span>

consists of:</p><p>Network interceptors is implemented as kernel module deployed in linux kernel.
It can rapidly filter out great amount of network traffic based on rules configured
on back-end server. The amount of network data is significantly reduced as delivered
to user layer in interceptor host.</p><p>The back-end server receives data from several interceptors and processed for
further analysis and presentation. Threads backed by buffers process data step by
step like pipeline. Different procedures are executed by different threads for
better performance and modularity.</p><p>On database level, some optimization like proper indexing and partition are applied.</p><p> </p><h3>Between Jobs</h3><p>May 2005 – Feb 2006 . 8 mos at Nanjing, Jiangsu, China</p><p>I was studying and preparing for higher degree.</p><p> </p><h4>5.5 Java Coder</h4><p>At <span><a target="_blank" href="http://www.softwise.com.cn">Softwise</a>  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.softwise.com.cn">[+]</a></span><br/>
