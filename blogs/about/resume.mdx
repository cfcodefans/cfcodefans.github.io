#### 5.1. Java Coder 

At [The NetCircle](https://thenetcircle.com){target="_blank"}
Jun 2012 – Present . 6 yrs 11 mos at Shanghai China

    As Java coder, I started with development of services built with java
, supporting our websites. Image/Video process, Message queuing, Payment, 
Single Sign On, Blockchain(NEM)....

    Gradually, I have studied and shifted to data area as our team aims to 
become data driven. I familiarize tools/framework for data mining, which brought
me to new horizon.

    As technology & tools always evolve and improve to be more user-friendly, 
I still feel quite distant to the math/statistic principles behind data science.

    As we generate more and more data in our lives, data also shapes our minds.
I wish to explore more in this complexity.

    In practice, apart from development for java systems, I have also been working 
as data engineer, setting up infrastructures like Hadoop cluster, Hive, Kafka. 
Process clean data for data scientists.

    Overall, I grow with sharing knowleages between amazing colleagues.

##### Projects

###### 5.1.1 Community-Token (Feb 2018 - Present) [NEM](https://nem.io/){target="_blank"} / Kotlin / Spring-Boot / Mongodb

The idea is to implement some reward mechanism to reward active users who create great 
content, contribute in our online community. The trick is possible monetary incentive 
associated with crypto currency for users, as well as other benefit of block chain tech,
such as transparency, immutability, convenient as well.

In detail, NEM features:
1. proof of importance,
2. multi-sign transaction
3. escrow
4. atomic swap(exchange) 

However the transaction speed is always critical impediment to block chain application, 
caused by nature of block chain tech. To address, we adopt private chain, similar to
Bitcoin's lightning network.
    
<p>&nbsp;</p>

###### 5.1.2 Data-Service-ETL (May 2019 – Present) [Canal](https://github.com/alibaba/canal){target="_blank"} / Hive / [Green Plum](https://gpdb.docs.pivotal.io/6-0/main/index.html) / [Superset](https://superset.incubator.apache.org/)

For data collected from Kafka, I developed UDF in Hive which could pull data from kafka
with in certain time window defined as parameters. This primarily collects data generated
by users' actions, as fact table.

Besides this, Canal can impersonate a mysql slave to collect data changes on a mysql instance.
Dimenson tables changes are collected and stored by date.

Raw data (ods) collected and load into Hive tables where ETL processes are implemented by 
Hive SQL, which could utilize some UDF functions I developed, to operate data via http 
services, Redis, Zookeeper. Hive Storage Handler is also very useful for Hive to access 
data in various JDBC-compatible data source.

Data in Hive is loaded into GreenPlum, which is multiple Postgresql instances organized 
in cluster, able to support adhoc queries. 

Last piece is Superset, a BI tool which renders data with dozens of different charts.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

###### 5.1.3 Data-Service-setup (Jul 2018 – Present) Hadoop / Zookeeper / Kafka / Hive / Green Plum

Install, deploy and configure Hadoop cluster, with High Availability feature, optimized
settings.

Install and integrate components for our data services, including: Kafka for event bus;
Hive for ETL engineer; Green Plum for storage for adhoc queries/charts; Zookeeper to
support others.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

###### 5.1.4 Single-Sign-On (Feb 2018 – Jul 2018) [Apache Oltu](https://oltu.apache.org/){target="_blank"} / Mongodb / Scala / LDAP

A single sign on feature built with Apache Oltu Library and LDAP using scala/jersey/webservice, 
it guards our internal services for users from different departments.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

###### 5.1.5 Data-misc-tools (Jul 2017 – Feb 2018) Hive / Kafka / Redis / Mysql

This project hosts several tools to help with development using Hive, Spark. Please check it 
out on github

To study and apply how to leverage new features of Hive, Spark, Hadoop for data process, I 
created and am developing some functions for Hive and spark. It sounds like reinventing wheel, 
but I believe it has certain value as:

1. it utilizes the dynamic characteristic of scala language, so that it recognizes the 
modification of scala script files on HDFS, takes effect immediately, saving the cumbersome 
steps of compile, package, deployment, restart spark process. Theoretically this can apply 
other JSR233 compatible languages.

1.1 I have finished the feature to support python as well, python code can be saved and edited 
with HUE, then it will take effect immediately too

2. It can use just HIVE sql to load/send data via HTTP, kafka, Redis with extended HIVE 
function. Most of a ETL process can be implemented by only HIVE sql.

3. Some supportive features are also provided, such simple task scheduler, task execution 
tracking.

Feedback or contribution is highly appreciated.

###### 5.1.5 Video Conversion Service (Jan 2016 - Present) [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/){target="_blank"} / Kotlin / [Red5](http://red5.org/)

A service can convert videos uploaded by users to different formats, also add watermarks 
and extract thumbnails. I developed this based on Red5 Server with Spring, Spring-MVC and
kotlin.

Besides these, we are developing video live-streaming feature to meet the needs of 
watching video stream on browser of mobile as we learn that majority of accesses 
are from mobile phones.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

###### 5.1.6 IPS (Image Process Service) (Jan 2013 - Jul 2018) [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/){target="_blank"} / Kotlin / Spring-boot

The service processes images uploaded by users, with features of crop, scale, overlay 
text and other images, rotate. 

The design borrowed the idea of CSS, we define some schemas in json like css to describe
how the images should be crop, scale, ...etc. Like CSS, we also had variables in the 
schemas so image processing could be dynamic according to requests.

The development for this is ongoing for years, as we always found some new challenges.
Firstly, with upgrade of mobile phones of users led to images significantly increasing in 
both number and size (3000x2000-ish) over just couple of years. The early version of IPS 
failed to process images fast. 

After studying logs and tests, I firstly made processing executed in parallel threads to 
maximize use of multi-cores; checked the memory footprint to reduce unnecessary copy
    (image data is massive after uncompressing); replaced Processing Library (based on Java) 
with OpenCV (based on C++);

I also tried to extend it to support GIF, face recognition, similar image search, etc.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

###### 5.1.7 Joint (Jul 2014 – Jul 2015) [JavaEE](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-ee-glance.html){target="_blank"} / [Swagger](https://swagger.io/)

This is actually a open-source and study project. I noticed the great development of 
frontend technology and gap between it with backend technology.

Before, Backend tech stack (JSF, PHP...) covers the rendering of HTML with template 
technology. These became quickly outmoded as webpage development were taken over by
Javascript libraries.

However, backend turns to service oriented. Restful services were described by WSDL, 
which was not recognized by javascript(since js is dynamic, weak-typed language).

Finally, Typescript alleivated the problem but not ultimate solution. I tried to build
some library to read, parse the annotations on Restful service API, and automatically
generate whole bunch of typescript definitions for service invocation.

Now we know that Swagger does this way better. I still learned a lot from this useless
project.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

###### 5.1.7 MQueue Dispatcher (Mar 2014 – 2016) [Rabbit MQueue](https://www.rabbitmq.com){target="_blank"} / Java 8 / React

The system constantly consumes messages from Rabbit MQueue according to predefined rules,
relays messages over http protocol to corresponding PHP modules. It also implements retry 
mechanism and failed messages storage for maintenance.

The design is a series of producer-consumer patterns combined with state transit, with 
each step performs different tasks: 
1. pull from queue; 
2. post to http service;
3. check result to decide whether to:
    3.1 reply queue with ack;
    3.2 store failed message, mark the retry count;

The challenge is building a fast assembly line with async queues, and tweak performance
of HTTP library. 

<p>&nbsp;</p>

##### 5.1.8 Search Service (Oct 2019 - present)

Solr based full text search service, designed and developed to support websites, 
End users search profiles, locations, feeds via search service, 
on the other handle, Data service collects users' search keyword and following browse
actions, to feed related data analysis.

#### 5.2 Senior Java Engineer
At [DB Schenker SSC](https://www.dbschenker.com/global){target="_blank"}
Aug 2010 – Jul 2012 . 2 yrs at Nanjing, Jiangsu, China

Software Environment:
Websphere, Seam, JSF, Oracle, EJB, JPA, LDAP
Development Tools:
Eclipse + JBossTools

Project Description:

    The SMPNG system is leveraged by many different aspects of JEE technologies, 
whole JEE stack is applied in the system, to present users a modernized and clean 
application. In order to gather and dispatch logistic transaction information from
many branches over the world, the SMPNG system is also backed by many other message
sources. 

    I had been working on this project in Germany with German colleagues for six weeks.
From clients, new features were designed for handling booking and tracking operations. 
It ought to replace the legacy SMPNG system and present business logic in more modern 
and user-friendly style.

    As a member of the group, I had managed to communicate and collaborate with
colleagues from different countries and with different backgrounds. From my experience, 
I learned that some things are beyond language barrier, mainly caused by different
mindset and culture or roles, while some communication skills would be very effective 
solution to break down misunderstanding and deliver ideas.

    This job taught me much about those advanced tools used in enterprise development. 
sonar for code checking, Jenkins for continuous integration, Fisheyes for refacotory, 
all those are very useful tools for big scale software development.

Responsibilities:
Module Design, Programming and unit testing, collaboration between German customers 
and other developers.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

##### Projects

###### 5.2.1 e-schenker (Jul 2010 – Jun 2011) JavaEE / [JSF](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/javaserverfaces-139869.html){target="_blank"} / [Seam](http://seamframework.org){target="_blank"}

This project is used for DB Schenker corporation‘s logistics management. Include customer 
information maintenance, booking management, logistics branch office maintenance, cargo 
tracking and tracing process. It covers three types of transport mode in logistics area, they 
are AIR, OCEAN and LAND respectively. Both customer and business clerk around the world should 
use this system to deal with logistics.

The system is empowered by JEE tech stack and Seam Framework. The application of JEE tech is 
modular and multi-layered and developers are relieved from much work to deal with database or 
web server. The new JEE 6 spec provides EJB3.1, CDI(Context Dependency Injection), RESTful API, 
JSF etc, which are very Java-Programmer-friendly.

#### 5.3 Senior Java Engineer
At [ZTE Coporation](https://www.zte.com.cn/global/){target="_blank"}
Apr 2008 – Aug 2010 . 2 yrs 5 mos at Nanjing, Jiangsu, China

Project Description:

    It is often referred as NMS, and includes various function modules for different
network managements, such as Vlan, Vpn, Switcher, Router. because target 
Operation Systems are both of windows and Solarise (lots of NMS run on SUN server)
    , so Java and Swing UI could be the best option.

    JEE techniques, such as EJB, JMS, are very helpful for building highly flexible 
System. SNMP and CLI are two mainly measures used in device operations.
This product has been developed for couple yearsnetnumen Network Management, and it is 
getting more capable of  management of big scale network. our target is to make it more 
effective and robust.

Responsibilities:
    I am working in support group that developers utilities modules relieving other
workmates of trifles such as DB operations, UI pattern. we found that most of 
business modules might include same functions, and we abstract those, and plan to
build support base module, this was my challenging job.

    Lesson I learned, To develop base components used to support many other 
concrete modules, it is important not to abuse design patterns and complicate the 
interface. otherwise, colleagues would hate your over-engineering code. More over, 
interfaces should be made flexible enough with OOP principles so that components 
can be reused in various cases at minimum cost, otherwise your manager would hate 
your code.

##### Projects

###### 5.3.1 netnumen Network Management (May 2008 – Aug 2010) 

This platform is developed by ZTE data network department. It consists of components
of network interface, SNMP, telnet, Persistence layer, User Interfaces assembled in 
a modular manner. 

From technical point of view, it is empowered by combination of JEE and Swing 
tech stack so it is portable and compatible to different databases and other 
systems built on Java.

From architecture point of view, It is designed to be modular and extensible. 
Components for different business logics are developed easily based on platform 
infrastructure modules, they interact via interfaces and JMS message.

As to my work in this project, I was tasked to develop utilities and UI framework 
to support other colleagues' development. I applied design patterns inside the 
module for flexibility and modularity and exposed interfaces for simplicity. Users
simply use them or inherit them. 

<p>&nbsp;</p>

#### 5.4 Senior Java Engineer
At [AsiaInfo Linkage](http://www.lianchuang.com/){target="_blank"}
Feb 2006 – Apr 2008 . 2 yrs 3 mos at Nanjing, Jiangsu, China

Product Development
    I worked in LianChuang Technology that has been taken by AsiaInfo after my 
resignation. During that period, I took part in development of SAS system. This 
web-based system was designed to collect and analyze business operation data in 
big scale enterprise by intercepting the network traffic in intranet without any 
intrusion on existent systems. Further more, System admins are also able to define 
business rules to monitor operations on critical resources, such as database and 
hosts.

    As designer of the back end server module of the product, I studied some 
patterns of thread use and java optimization skills. With application of those 
in work, the product server application is able to handle great heavy workload 
with commercial hardware.

    We also used some long-pulling technology to improve users interface so it 
would allow system admins to monitor operations on servers immediately like real-time.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

###### 5.4.1 Securer Security Audit System (Mar 2006 – Apr 2008)

This web-based system was designed to collect and analyse business operation data 
in big scale enterprise by intercepting the network traffic in intranet without 
any intrusion on existent systems. Further more, System admins are also able to 
define business rules to monitor operations on critical resources, such as 
database and hosts.

The greatest challenge is performance. Therefore the architecture of this system 
consists of:

Network interceptors is implemented as kernel module deployed in linux kernel. 
It can rapidly filter out great amount of network traffic based on rules configured 
on back-end server. The amount of network data is significantly reduced as delivered
to user layer in interceptor host.

The back-end server receives data from several interceptors and processed for 
further analysis and presentation. Threads backed by buffers process data step by 
step like pipeline. Different procedures are executed by different threads for 
better performance and modularity.

On database level, some optimization like proper indexing and partition are applied.

At [Softwise](http://www.softwise.com.cn){target="_blank"}    
Aug 2003 – Apr 2005 . 8 mos at Nanjing, Jiangsu, China

    First job as programmer, I worked in projects sourced from Japan big companies.
Just like Chinese software industry started with outsourcing projects and grow with 
Japanese management. I went through classic water-fall software development cycle
and built up my basic Java skill. 

I also got to learn some advance tech (by then), 
such as [adobe coldfusion](https://helpx.adobe.com/coldfusion/cfml-reference/coldfusion-tags.html){target="_blank"}, 
[webmethod](https://www.softwareag.com/corporate/products/webmethods_integration/adapter/default.html){target="_blank"}
