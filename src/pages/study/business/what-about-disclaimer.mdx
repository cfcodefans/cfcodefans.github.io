As viewers in most time, the terms on websites/apps are the least concerned. I'd just click/tap on the "accept" button to
shut the terms down asap. However, when table is turned and I wish to switch roles to be makers of online content, 
I can't help asking myself

<!--more-->

"are those articles I have written legit in all levels?"

It is very necessary to put **disclaimer** on these pages, it is my obligation to avoid unintended obligations. 
After brief study on [disclaimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disclaimer), with my limit English..... I can see why people are pound of degrees from law school.

Alright, with rough idea of disclaimer and what I want to say, I am gonna put

<div className="m-5">

Almost okay, says the [grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/grammar-check)....

To my surprise, there are actually online tools that help generate disclaimer..... I have to test it.
The [Termly.io](https://termly.io/products/disclaimer-generator/)

It would show you some wizard to take some parameters of disclaimer, such as company name, site name
the coverage of disclaimer, like reference, personal contacts .... etc.

The outcome is quite dazzling...

As disclaimer, I don't mean to endorse it, just It is quite smart to take this angle to dig structure of disclaimers 
and make a tool to help generate professional ones, and profit from it. The disclaimer is output into HTML fragments
for free package (attached with its branding).

However HTML is not coder-friendly for my small site built with [nextjs](https://nextjs.org/), everything is react
component. I made it into a html file and simply showed it in iframe..... One technical advantage for HTML format is 
full control. Termly also offers Pro package that hosts the disclaimer on their site with support of attorneys.

In the end, for my humble blog-site, I would go back to my own naive disclaimer for now before I finish study the formal
disclaimer generated by termly. "Not a disclaimer, I do know about my disclaimer <i className="far fa-meh-rolling-eyes"></i>"
